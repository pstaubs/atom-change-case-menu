# atom-change-case-menu
An atom wrapper for [node-change-case](https://github.com/blakeembrey/change-case) featuring a configurable selection dialogue with live preview. This package is inspired by [atom-change-case](https://github.com/robhurring/atom-change-case), which I thought needed a faster way of accessing and previewing case styles.

Case changing styles can be accessed individually as with [atom-change-case](https://github.com/robhurring/atom-change-case), or interactively with a dialogue (the dialogue's hotkey defaults to shift+F3 which coincides with MSO's default case changing hotkey).
