# atom-change-case-menu
An atom wrapper for [node-change-case](https://github.com/blakeembrey/change-case) featuring a configurable selection dialogue with live preview, quick style cycle, and menu-based case changing. This package is inspired by [atom-change-case](https://github.com/robhurring/atom-change-case), which I thought needed a faster way of accessing and previewing case styles. The quick style cycle emulates MSO case change functionality (hotkey defaults to shift+F3).
